# ARGOS-Labs POT SDK on Windows 10

Welcome to the Python-to-Operation Toolset (POT) SDK for ARGOS Low-code platform. This doucoment will show you how to develop and release a plugin from your Python solution.

## Prerequisites

Before your start, let's prepare your POT SDK environment. There are 3 pieces of software you need to install.
- Python interpreter
- The POT SDK
- IDE (PyCharm)

### [Installing Python Interpreter](Install_Python_Interpreter_Windows10.md)

You will need **Python 3.7.3 32bit on Windows 10**. Please select the **32bit** version even when your OS is 64bit because of compatibility reasons.

### [Installing ARGOS POT SDK](Install_ARGOS_POT_SDK_Windows10.md)

ARGOS POT SDK consists of three components as follows:

| Item | Minimum version | Role | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [alabs.common](https://pypi-official.argos-labs.com/#/package/alabs-common) | 3.721.1350 | SDK library | Library for SDK |
| [alabs.icon](https://pypi-official.argos-labs.com/#/package/alabs-icon) | 1.711.2351 | icon utility | This utility make plugin icon |
| [alabs.ppm](https://pypi-official.argos-labs.com/#/package/alabs-ppm) | 4.115.1700 | POT utility | POT main utility |


### [Installation of PyCharm IDE](Install_PyCharm_Windows10.md)

This guide is based on one of the most popular Python [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
* `PyCharm` Community Edition

## How to build a ARGOS Low-Code Python Plugin

The step by step guide for how to build ARGOS Low-Code Python plugin.

#### [Download template](Download_Template.md)

When starting a new project, you must prepare a base folder from `Template` everytime. Then, you must set configuration for `PyCharm` IDE.
You can download the `Template` folder in which you will find several files including 

#### [PyCharm settings](PyCharm_Settings_Windows10.md)
You must complete the IDE settings after preparation of Template.

## Coding for plugin
This document will show you how to code from the scaffolding template.

### [Set package name](Set_Package_name_Windows10.md)

You need to change python package name from `argoslabs.demo.helloworld` to `argoslabs.myplugin.asciiart` for example.

### [Sample code and dependent module](Install_Dependent_modules_Windows10.md)

When your plugin requires installation of any third party modules (dependent modules) from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). This guild will show you how to do it.

### [Main Coding at `__init__.py`](Main_Coding_Windows10.md)

Plugin's main code is made from the source, `argoslabs/myplugin/asciiart/__init__.py`.

### [Testing and validating for the unique name](Testing_Windows10.md)

Every code needs to be tested as much as possible. Also, it is required to have a unique name for your package like `argoslabs.gourp.plugin_name` and for your display name that will appear under `STU`'s Icon. This guild will show you how to test your plugin with unittest and to check for the unique names. 

### [Tags and Version](Setup_yaml.md)
Before building the plugin you have to set tags and version for that plugin.

### [Writing the help document with README.md](Usage_Help_with_README.md)
Each plugin must have a usage help. The README.md contents will be linked the STU's help button. This guide shows how to make this help contents.

## Building your plugin

Now that everything is ready. Let's build your plugin.

### [Preparing private repository](Preparing_Private_Repository_Windows10.md)

After building your plugin, you can upload it to your own Python private repository. This guide shows how to install private repository and configuration at Supervisor.

### [Creating an icon for your plugin](build_icon_plugin_Windows10.md)
You must select a fitting image and make an icon using `alabs.icon` utility and then you can build this plugin with `build.bat` batch file.

## After making plugin

Once you build your own plugin, it's time to make a bot with `STU` for testing. And you may need to upgrade the plugin if needed.

### [How to make a test bot with STU](Make_testing_bot_STU.md)

Now your plugin is registered at private repository so you can make use of this plugin. This guide shows how to make a bot using your plugin.

### [How to upgrade your plugin](How_to_Upgrade_plugin.md)
Because plugin is a normal software it need to fix or upgrade if needed. This guide shows how to upgrade your plugin.
