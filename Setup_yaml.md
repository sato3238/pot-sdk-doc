# Tags and Versions

Tags are not only helpful for users to search and locate your plugin in the STU's toolbox. Versions must be managed by you so that the user can select the right version for their automation projectss. The Operating System specifications are important as the users can know whether or not your plugin is portable between multiple OS's like Windows and Linux.

You can find `setup.yaml` file at `asciiart` folder in which main code `__init__.py` exists.

This YAML file looks like:

```yaml

* `version` - plugin's version

> **Note** - There are three parts in the template for Python package name to change `argoslabs.demo.helloworld` to your's `argoslabs.myplugin.asciiart` in this example.
> * At the file `plugin-template\argoslabs\myplugin\asciiart\setup.yaml`:
>   > `argoslabs.demo.helloworld: ['icon.*', 'README*.*']`
>   > Change from above line to next line
>   > `argoslabs.myplugin.asciiart: ['icon.*', 'README*.*']`
> * At the file `plugin-template\argoslabs\myplugin\asciiart\main.py`:
>   > `from argoslabs.demo.helloworld import main`
>   > Change from above line to next line
>   > `from argoslabs.myplugin.asciiart import main`
> * At the file `plugin-template\argoslabs\myplugin\asciiart\tests\test_me.py`:
>   > `from argoslabs.demo.helloworld import _main as main`
>   > Change from above line to next line
>   > `from argoslabs.myplugin.asciiart import _main as main`
> 
> *Sometimes import statements can be changed automatically by refectoring functionality at main.py or test_me.py but sometimes not. So before building all be sure to checking above three references.*
